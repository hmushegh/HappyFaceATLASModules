weight = 1.0

definition  = Warning if a significant number of jobs has walltime ratio below 10%. Jobs considered for warning and error rating are jobs in the group "cmsproduction".
instruction = A low walltime ratio could be caused by jobs waiting for data. If this is due to not staged files which first have to be retrieved from tape, this behaviour is expected. However if this porblem shows up for data residing on the dCache read pools, then a low walltime ratio points towards a problem with the performance of the dCache system. Or as a third possibility: inefficient jobs at all.
