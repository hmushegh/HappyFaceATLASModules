 HappyFace3 Tools Directory
============================

Place tool-scripts in this directory, their name will
be used to call it using the tools.py script. So a
file DUMMY.py will imply a call like
 python tools.py DUMMY

The file will be imported as a module, then the existance
of the module variable 'load_hf_environment' will be
checked. If it is set to True, HappyFace will be loaded
prior to calling the execute(...) function.

After eventually loading HappyFace, execute() is called.
Write everything you want the tool to do in that file.

You can access sys.args if you need the command line arguments,
but be aware that the element with index 0 is the name 
of the calling command *plus* the first argument (name of the tool)!
