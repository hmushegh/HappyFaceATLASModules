HappyFace is a flexible meta-monitoring system, designed to aggregate expert monitoring data from various sources. It gives shifters and site maintainers the ability to check the site status by looking at a single web page. The data is not only aggregated and displayed on web page, but also stored in a database, giving shifters and administrators a powerful tool to introspect the site status at any time in the past.
