HappyFace â€“ The Meta Monitoring Framework
*****************************************


* Powerful site specific monitoring system for data from multiple input sources.
* Collects, processes, rates and presents all important monitoring information
* for the overall status and the services of a local or Grid computing site. 

* Monitoring data is subdivided in multiple categories.
* Each category is subdivided in multiple modules which corresponds to one single test.
* Simple rating system: -1 = no info / error; status float value = 0.0 .. 1.0 (critical .. fine)
* The overall status of the categories can be calculated from the individual module statii with different algorithms.
